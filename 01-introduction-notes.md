# Introduction

* Applications consist of *Activities* and *Layouts*. 
* An activity is a instance of the `Activity` class that the Android SDK provides. 
* Developers write _sublcasses_ of `Activity` to implement the functionality that your application requires. 
* A _layout_ defines a set of user interface objects and their position on the screen.
* A layout is made of elements defined in XML.
* **Activities** are the Java implementation and management of the **Layout** you define in XML.
