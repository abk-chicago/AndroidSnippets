# Introduction

* Applications consist of *Activities* and *Layouts*. 
* An activity is a instance of the `Activity` class that the Android SDK provides. 
* Developers write _sublcasses_ of `Activity` to implement the functionality that your application requires. 
* A _layout_ defines a set of user interface objects and their position on the screen.
* A layout is made of elements defined in XML.
* **Activities** are the Java implementation and management of the **Layout** you define in XML.

#### App Names: The Reverse DNS

Package names for applications use the reverse DNS structure. This convention is designed to create application package names uniqure.

#### Targetting SDK Version 23+

* If we target Marshmallow (Android 6.0) whichn is SDK version 23 or newer...
* We have to support runtime applicaiton permission requests.
* This can make life really confused at the start.
* Let's not target Marshmallow... _yet_.
* **Soon** we will dive into the deliciousness of Marshmallow. _Core skills first_.

## Widgets

**Widgets** are the building blocks you use to create a user interface with. If you create a default application in Android Studio, you are presented two widgets for your first layout - `RelativeLayout` and `TextView`. Using the Android SDK, we can configure the appearance and behaviour of widgets. Each widget is an instance of the `View` class (or one of its subclasses, such as `ImageView` or `TextView`).

##### Common Widget Attributes

Let's become familiar with a few common attributes (which are better known as properties of an object) that we'll see.

* `layout_width` with values such as `match_parent` (the content will match the parent's size) and `wrap_content` (only as large as content requires)
* `layout_height` with values such as `match_parent` and `wrap_content`
* `padding` with values measured using `dp`
* `orientation` with values that allow content to be rendered in a `horizontal` or `vertical` fashion
* `text` with any **String** value, such as `Hello world!` or `Hi, grandpa!` 

##### Widgets are written as XML

Each widget is declared as an **XML element**. Each _attribute_ is an property of that widget. 

## View Hierarchy

Widgets compose a hierarchy of `View` objects named **view hierarchy**. There will always be a _root_ (or base) element. This will typically be a layout (`LinearLayout`, `RelativeLayout`, `FrameLayout`, or `TableLayout`). These _layouts_ inherit from a subclass of `View` named `ViewGroup`. Widgets are then contained inside of these _groups of views_, or as we know them, `ViewGroup`s.

## Strings

We shouldn't write any direct strings into our project. It is bad practice and can make updating things down the road harder. Every Android application may (and likely will) contain a `app/res/values` folder. Inside is a `strings.xml` file. You'll notice a `Resources` element with children strings. You may add strings using the `snake_case` syntax as names. Each *name* may then be referenced under the `R.string` namespace.

##### WARNING 

_Do not delete any Strings you are unfamiliar with. Some of these are generated when your project is created~_
